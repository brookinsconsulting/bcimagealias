BC ImageAlias extension INSTALL

Introduction
============

1. What is the BC ImageAlias extension?
   ------------------------------------------------

   BC ImageAlias is a true eZ Publish extension that
   provides commandline script, workflow event and class
   methods to generate content object image alias variations.

   For more information about this extension please read the README file.

2. Requirements
   ------------

   The following requirements exists for using BC ImageAlias extension:

   o  eZ Publish version:

      Make sure you use eZ Publish version 4.x (required) or higher.

      eZ Publish 4.6.x+ (Community Build, 2011.11+) is recommended.

   o  PHP version:

      Make sure you have PHP 5.x or higher.


Getting eZ Publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ Publish from share.ez.no,
you will find the various versions at:

http://share.ez.no/download

NOTE: You will only require eZ Publish 4.x or higher (if you have a more recent version)

Information on the installation of eZ Publish can be found at:
http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.6/Installation
and
http://doc.ez.no
http://share.ez.no


Installing BC ImageAlias extension
==============================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ Publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf bcimagealias-0_0_22.tar.gz
   [zip]:
   $ unzip bcimagealias-0_0_22.tar.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ Publish.

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   root_of_ezpublish/settings/override/. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=bcimagealias

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site_user/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=bcimagealias


4. There is no need to configure BC ImageAlias extension after activation


5. Enable kernel overrides

5.1 Kernel Override Requirements

Kernel Class Overrides based on eZ Publish 4.6.x >= 4.6 ( Community Build, 2011.11+ ).

While BCImageAlias by default requires both kernel overrides to provide the features within eZ Publish. 

Though based on your usage (like what version of eZ Publish are you using bcimagealias with?) of the bcimagealias extension (which parts of the extension do you require, which do you not require?) you may be able to avoid using the provided kernel overrides entirely.

If you do not use the 'related-siteaccess' script parameter, workflow event ini setting, and php class property, then you will not require the 'extension/bcimagealias/lib/ezimage/classes/ezimagemanager.php' (modified) kernel class override be installed. The ezimagemanager class was modified to allow loading alias settings from multiple siteaccess ini override files and the default ini file directly to allow eZ Publish to create all the image aliases defined by default (in image.ini) and in several siteaccesses (related siteacesses setting in current siteaccess). Without this you additional functionality you can only generate image aliases defined within the current siteaccess. This may or may not be a concern to others depending on your specific use cases.

Users of eZ Publish version 'Community Build 2011.11' or greater do not require the kernel override 'extension/bcimagealias/kernel/classes/datatypes/ezimage/ezimagealiashandler.php' (unmodified) at all and likely never will.

The kernel override 'extension/bcimagealias/kernel/classes/datatypes/ezimage/ezimagealiashandler.php' was introduced into the extension in the aim of providing a convenient alternative to upgrading your entire eZ Publish 4.x installation to the 2011.11 build when all you need is one php class file to accomplish the task at hand, remove image aliases or generate them. This override if unused may be removed from the extension in the future.

Also there were issues with the changes introduce in 2011.09 build later resolved in the 2011.11 build. Users of eZ Publish Community Build 2011.09, 2011.10 (or any version before) should likely use our provided kernel override as the extension is designed to use this version specifically for most use cases (our unmodified copies come from the 2011.11 build sources in which the previous issues are correctly resolved). After you upgrade to or beyond eZ Publish Community build 2011.11 you can remove this kernel override.

   eZ Publish 4.x >= 4.0 - BCImageAlias by default requires both kernel overrides for this version of eZ Publish
   -- Kernel Override File: extension/bcimagealias/kernel/classes/datatypes/ezimage/ezimagealiashandler.php
   -- Kernel Override File: extension/bcimagealias/lib/ezimage/classes/ezimagemanager.php

   eZ Publish 4.6.x >= 4.6 ( Community Build, 2011.09+ ) - BCImageAlias by default requires both kernel overrides for this version of eZ Publish
   -- Kernel Override File: extension/bcimagealias/kernel/classes/datatypes/ezimage/ezimagealiashandler.php
   -- Kernel Override File: extension/bcimagealias/lib/ezimage/classes/ezimagemanager.php

   eZ Publish 4.6.x >= 4.6 ( Community Build, 2011.10+ ) - BCImageAlias by default requires only one kernel override for this version of eZ Publish
   -- Kernel Override File: extension/bcimagealias/lib/ezimage/classes/ezimagemanager.php

   eZ Publish 4.6.x >= 4.6 ( Community Build, 2011.11+ ) - BCImageAlias by default requires only one kernel override for this version of eZ Publish
   -- Kernel Override File: extension/bcimagealias/lib/ezimage/classes/ezimagemanager.php

   eZ Publish 4.6.x >= 4.6 ( Community Build, 2011.12+ ) - BCImageAlias by default requires only one kernel override for this version of eZ Publish
   -- Kernel Override File: extension/bcimagealias/lib/ezimage/classes/ezimagemanager.php


5.2 Remember to edit your config.php and enable this line:

define( 'EZP_AUTOLOAD_ALLOW_KERNEL_OVERRIDE', true );


6. Regenerate eZ Publish class autoloads

You must regenerate autoloads for both extension and kernel overrides. This may mean running two different commands.


cd /path/to/ezpublish;

php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -v -e;

php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -v -o;


7. (optional) Workflow & Trigger Setup
   ===========================
   If you wish to have content object image alias variations created just before objects are published. Enable this workflow and clear caches.

   A) In the eZ Publish admin, go to Setup -> Workflows
      and click New Workflow Group.

   B) Name the group something like "Image Alias Variation Creation" and click OK.
      The group will be added to the workflow groups.

   C) Click on the group you have just created, and in the
      Workflows box click the "New Workflow" button.

      1) Name the workflow "Generate Image Alias Variation Image Files".

      3) You will now see an Event select dropdown.
         1) Select "Event / BC ImageAlias - Generate Object Image Alias Variation Image Files"

         2) Confirm you choice by clicking the "Add Event" button
            just to the right of the select dropdown.

      4) Enter a description "BC Image Alias Workflow event"

      5) Click OK to save your workflow.

   D) Now click on the Triggers link in the left hand menu.

      In the table "Workflow Triggers" you will see a list of available triggers.

      On the line: 'content, publish, after', (Workflow Drop Down)
      "Click" the dropdown select the workflow event you have just created.

   E) Clear all caches

   F) After you have followed all these steps, the extension's
      workflow settings should be activated, configured and functioning properly.


8. (optional) Content Object Publish: Testing Workflow & Trigger Setup
   ===========================
   After completing the above setup you should login to eZ Publish
   create or edit a content object which uses the image datatype
   (ezimagetype datatype) in one or more content object attributes,
   add at least one image to image attribute, publish your content object.

   Next, Locate the newly created image alias variation image files in the related var directory.
