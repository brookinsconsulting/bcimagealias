BC Image Alias TODO
=================================================

There are still quite a lot of features we could
add to BC Image Alias.

A few users of BC Image Alias may require further
extension of the default eZ Publish image alias
image variation image file related features.

If you are interested in sponsoring the development
of any of these features for your eZ Publish web site,
please contact info@brookinsconsulting.com


Features for consideration:

- Regenerating specific image alias's image variation image files alone
- Regenerating image alias's image variation image files of only
  a specific subtree of the content object tree node content tree
- Remove image alias's image variation image files of non-published
  versions to reduce disk usage.
- Different debug options
- Logging options
- Any other changes not mentioned here
