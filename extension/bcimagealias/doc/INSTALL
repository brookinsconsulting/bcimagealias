2. Requirements
   ------------

   The following requirements exists for using BC ImageAlias extension:

   o  eZ publish version:

      Make sure you use eZ publish version 4.x or higher.

      eZ Publish 2011.10 (4.5+) is recommended.

   o  PHP version:

      Make sure you have PHP 5.x or higher.


Getting eZ Publish
==================

You can download a version of eZ Publish from share.ez.no,
you will find the various versions at:

http://share.ez.no/download

NOTE: You will require eZ Publish 4.x or higher

Information on the installation of eZ publish can be found at:
http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.5/Installation
and
http://doc.ez.no
http://share.ez.no


Installing BC ImageAlias extension
==============================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory
   in the root of your eZ publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command
   necessary is depends on the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf bcimagealias-0_0_20.tar.gz
   [zip]:
   $ unzip bcimagealias-0_0_20.tar.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ publish.

   To do this edit site.ini.append(.php) in the folder
   root_of_ezpublish/settings/override/. If this file does not exist;
   create it. Locate (or add) the block

   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:
   ActiveExtensions[]=bcimagealias

   If you run several sites using only one distribution
   and only some of the sites should use the extension,
   make the changes in the override file of that siteaccess.

   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/ezwebin_site_user/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=bcimagealias


4. There is no need to configure BC ImageAlias extension after activation


5. Regenerate eZ Publish class autoloads

cd /path/to/ezpublish;

php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -v -e;


6. (optional) Workflow & Trigger Setup
   ===========================
   If you wish to have content object image alias variations created just before objects are published. Enable this workflow and clear caches.

   A) In the eZ publish admin, go to Setup -> Workflows
      and click New Workflow Group.

   B) Name the group something like "Image Alias Variation Creation" and click OK.
      The group will be added to the workflow groups.

   C) Click on the group you have just created, and in the
      Workflows box click the "New Workflow" button.

      1) Name the workflow "Generate Image Alias Variation Image Files".

      3) You will now see an Event select dropdown.
         1) Select "Event / BC ImageAlias - Generate Object Image Alias Variation Image Files"

         2) Confirm you choice by clicking the "Add Event" button
            just to the right of the select dropdown.

      4) Enter a description "BC Image Alias Workflow event"

      5) Click OK to save your workflow.

   D) Now click on the Triggers link in the left hand menu.

      In the table "Workflow Triggers" you will see a list of available triggers.

      On the line: content, publish, before, (Workflow Drop Down)
      "Click" the dropdown select the workflow event
      you have just created.

   E) Clear all caches

   F) After you have followed all these steps, the extension's
      workflow settings should be activated, configured and functioning properly.


7. (optional) Content Object Publish: Testing Workflow & Trigger Setup
   ===========================
   After completing the above setup you should login to eZ publish
   create or edit a content object which uses the image datatype
   (ezimagetype datatype) in one or more content object attributes,
   add at least one image to image attribute, publish your content object.

   Next, Locate the newly created image alias variation image files in the related var directory.
